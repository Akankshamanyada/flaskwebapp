Certainly! Here's a description of the Flask web application code provided above:

**Description**:
This Flask web application implements a basic to-do list manager. It allows users to add tasks and view them in a simple web interface.

**Components**:
1. **Python Script (`app.py`)**:
   - Imports the necessary modules from Flask.
   - Initializes a Flask application.
   - Defines a sample to-do list (`tasks`) as an empty list.
   - Creates a route for the home page (`/`) that renders an HTML template (`index.html`) and passes the `tasks` list to it.
   - Defines a route to handle adding tasks (`/add_task`). When a task is submitted via a form, it extracts the task from the request, adds it to the `tasks` list, and redirects back to the home page.

2. **HTML Template (`templates/index.html`)**:
   - Displays the title "To-Do List".
   - Lists all tasks currently in the `tasks` list.
   - Provides a form for users to add new tasks. When submitted, the form sends a POST request to the `/add_task` route.

**Usage**:
- Users can access the application by running the Python script (`app.py`), which starts a Flask development server.
- Upon accessing the home page (`/`), users see the current list of tasks and can add new tasks using the provided form.

This application serves as a simple example of using Flask to create a dynamic web interface for managing tasks. It can be extended with additional features such as task deletion, task completion status, user authentication, and more, depending on the requirements.
